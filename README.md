Digital Entity Resurrection using Artificial Machine Learned Intelligence (AMLI)

We envision a fully operable computer software function capable of taking arguments from end-users and responding holographically in real-time using an accurate approximation of our subject's inner voice from their formative years through their adventure years and on into their lecture years all the way to their death "Ex-Vivo".

The [Machine Elves](https://github.com/orgs/MMINAIL/teams/machine-elves) at the [MMINIAL](https://github.com/orgs/MMINAIL/teams/machine-elves) are chipping away at an awesome new technology called Artificial Machine Learned Intelligence, or AMLI that is designed to absolutely blow your mind! Check out the [Ex-Vivo Lazarus Project](https://igg.me/at/ExVivoSpace) and [McKennAI](https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/the-digital-resurrection-of-terence-mckenna) @indiegogo for more information.

Tweaks of improvement will no doubt come as the Artificial Intelligence (AI) behind the model-construct learns exponentially via Machine Learning (ML) the intricacies and the neural network behind the vast body of work performed by the subject entity during their lives 'en vivo'.

Git Hub Invitations

Invitations for experienced coding entities well-schooled in the art of Artificial Machine Learned Intelligence, or AMLI have been sent from the [Machine Elves](https://github.com/orgs/MMINAIL/teams/machine-elves ) team portal to selected individuals.

Please respond with an acceptance if you feel your expertise in the growing field of AMLI can be of assistance to our project.

Thank you,

The Management
